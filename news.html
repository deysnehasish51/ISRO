                <h2>Earth in Focus: NISAR Satellite Successfully Launched</h2>
                <p>On July 30, 2025, ISRO and NASA successfully launched the NISAR satellite, one of the world’s most advanced Earth observation missions. Costing $1.5 billion, it carries NASA’s L-band and ISRO’s S-band radars, allowing centimeter-level accuracy in tracking surface changes.
                    Unlike optical satellites, NISAR works day and night, even through clouds, making it vital for studying climate change, glaciers, earthquakes, and disasters. For India, vulnerable to floods and cyclones, this data is invaluable for disaster management and long-term planning.
                    The mission also showcases ISRO’s expertise in large-scale satellite operations and strengthens Indo-US space ties. Its global data will support agriculture, forestry, and carbon studies, making NISAR a milestone in science and diplomacy.</p>

                <h2>ISRO’s First Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) Test Flight</h2>
                <p>In 2025, ISRO successfully advanced its Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program, aiming to reduce launch costs and increase mission efficiency. The RLV is designed to take off like a rocket and return like a plane, making it partially reusable for multiple missions.                           
                    Recent tests have focused on autonomous landing, thermal protection, and flight stability. These trials are critical for developing future spacecraft that can launch, land, and be relaunched, similar to global initiatives by NASA and SpaceX.
                    The RLV program demonstrates India’s growing expertise in cutting-edge space technologies, including aerodynamics, avionics, and re-entry physics.</p>

                <h2>Vyomitra, India’s First Female Humanoid Robot Astronaut</h2>
                <p>ISRO’s humanoid robot Vyomitra is set to play a key role in the Gaganyaan program. Designed to mimic human functions, Vyomitra will fly on an uncrewed test mission to simulate astronaut activities.
                    It can monitor cabin conditions, operate controls, and communicate with ground teams, helping validate spacecraft systems before actual astronauts fly. Vyomitra will be exposed to launch vibration, microgravity, and re-entry conditions, ensuring hardware safety.
                    Beyond science, Vyomitra represents inclusivity and innovation, symbolizing India’s progress in robotics and AI. Its mission is eagerly awaited as a step toward safe human spaceflight.</p>

                <h2>SUIT Instrument on Aditya-L1 Reveals Solar Secrets</h2>
                <p>Launched in 2023, ISRO’s Aditya-L1 mission has now delivered over a year of solar observations. Its Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) studies the Sun’s lower atmosphere in the UV spectrum.

        Findings from 2025 highlight solar flares, UV irradiance variations, and magnetic activity. This data helps scientists understand how solar activity influences Earth’s ozone layer, weather, and climate.

The success of SUIT proves India’s capability in advanced space science. Aditya-L1 continues to provide critical insights for both Indian and global researchers studying the Sun.</p>

                <h2>ISRO Marks 100th Launch from Sriharikota</h2>
                <p>In January 2025, ISRO celebrated its 100th rocket launch from Sriharikota with the GSLV-F15 carrying the NVS-02 NavIC satellite.
                    NavIC, India’s regional GPS-like system, now gains more accuracy and reliability through NVS-02. The mission also demonstrated ISRO’s advanced cryogenic engine technology and precise satellite placement.
                    Reaching 100 launches reflects ISRO’s growth in mission complexity, international collaborations, and reliable operations, benefiting navigation, weather, and communication services for India.</p>

                <h2>Mission Rate Doubles Between 2015–2025</h2>
                <p>ISRO announced that it completed twice as many missions in 2015–2025 compared to the previous decade.
                    This surge is due to expanded use of PSLV, GSLV, and SSLV rockets, along with more satellites for Earth observation, navigation, and interplanetary research. Enhanced facilities and greater private sector participation also boosted output.
                    The higher mission rate reflects ISRO’s growing ambition and capacity, bringing more data, revenue, and global recognition for Indian space science.</p>

                <h2>Venus Orbiter Mission Preparations Underway</h2>
                <p>ISRO has invited researchers to study archival Venus data as part of preparations for its upcoming Venus Orbiter Mission (VOM).
                    The mission will study Venus’s thick atmosphere, cloud systems, and greenhouse effect. Insights from existing data will help refine instruments and mission design.
                    By planning a Venus mission, India expands its interplanetary exploration after the Moon, Mars, and the Sun. This step places ISRO in the global effort to study Earth’s “twin planet”.</p>

                <h2>Indian Astronaut Shares Medical Insights from Space</h2>
                <p>In July 2025, Captain Shubhanshu Shukla became the first Indian to visit the International Space Station (ISS) on the Axiom Mission 4.
                He shared how medical procedures like CPR in microgravity differ from Earth. Zero gravity changes how chest compressions and body positioning work, requiring straps and special techniques.
                These insights are crucial for future Gaganyaan astronauts, improving emergency care and life-support planning in space. His experience inspires public trust in India’s human spaceflight journey.</p>
